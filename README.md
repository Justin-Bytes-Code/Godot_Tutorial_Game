# Godot_Tutorial_Game
 This is a Beginner level Godot Game. I used a tutorial that is found in the documentation to learn godot. Lately I'm not sure why but I wanted to remake it so I did just that. You can play it by downloading the release build!

Here is the link the Tutorial: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/01.project_setup.html
